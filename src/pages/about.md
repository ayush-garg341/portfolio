I'm a **software engineer with a strong systems and cybersecurity bent**, driven by curiosity about how software behaves *beneath* the abstractions.

I enjoy working close to the operating system and the network - where **performance, correctness, and security collide**. My work often involves backend systems, Linux internals, and networking, with a constant focus on understanding *how data actually moves*, *where it can break*, and *how it can be abused*.

A large part of my interest lies in **practical cybersecurity**. I spend time exploring packet flow, ARP behavior, routing, firewall rule evaluation (UFW / iptables), and traffic inspection using tools like Wireshark and Scapy. This hands-on exposure helps me reason clearly about attack surfaces, trust boundaries, and the real-world effectiveness of security controls.

Rather than treating security as a separate domain, I see it as a **systems property** - tightly coupled with architecture, concurrency, and performance. I like asking uncomfortable but important questions:
- What latency does deep packet inspection introduce?
- Where do firewalls silently fail?
- How do race conditions and async code affect authorization?
- What assumptions does this system make about trust?

My engineering work spans:
- **Backend systems** in Python, Go and PHP  
- **Concurrency models** (threads, multiprocessing, async runtimes)
- **Low-level performance exploration** (custom I/O, caching layers)
- **Infrastructure & service hardening** (Nginx, systemd, permissions, logging)
- **Developer tooling** including Neovim plugins and automation utilities

I build projects to **understand fundamentals**, not to chase trends. Many of my side projects start as experiments - packet sniffers, firewall-like prototypes, reverse indexes, sync tools - and evolve into something more robust as I learn where the real complexity lies.

Outside of coding, I document insights, share technical learnings, and continuously refine my mental models of systems under load - both accidental and adversarial.

If you're interested in **systems engineering, backend infrastructure, or real-world cybersecurity**, you'll probably find something here worth exploring.
